### Features

Color and font exploration (wip)
    Use the slider to pick a main hue/color
    Select from pre-determined fonts to determine general style
    Select a main color pallete to determine the tone/feel for the site

    When finding a good combonation, take a screenshot
        Then we can expand upon that baseline.

    Todo:
        Known issues:
            Resolve pallete issues (jewel is only one that turns text white)
            Slider is wonky at lower ranges
            Refresh does not keep changes

        Add more functionality
            Should be able to save a theme/set preferences
