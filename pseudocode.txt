Hello,
This should be a start to a consulting business website example.
For now it includes a menu and a base landing page template.

first need to refine the menu & general ui layer,
    for overall 'feel' of the website.

current direction
    replicate and expand upon 2+ examples.

    functionality (nav menu) :
        autohide/unhide when scrolling (complete)
        move image vertically when scrolling (todo).


once base landing page is set 
    refactor for customization (todo)
        choice of main hue (complete)
        choice of palette & display (complete)

    choice of fonts (complete)

refactor to make a setting menu (complete)
    allow expanded menu to be dynamic (ex, base, settings, advanced)
        or show with tabs?

re-structure style and layout to make it feel more intuative (todo)



each section should be its own file/template (todo)
    ex: hero section will load a template based on user choice
        same with menu/nav, content, footer, ect

    idea here is that when buiding a 'web-component' it can be used anywhere
        content is filled out via md docs or similar that can be converted to md files.
            why md? its easier than trying to stucture paragraph, list, and title elements (auto generated via md to html).
        user should be able to drop in any content into a folder and have it appear in the website
