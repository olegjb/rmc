This should be a start to a consulting business website example.
For now it includes a menu and a base landing page template.

first need to refine the menu & general ui layer,
    for overall 'feel' of the website.

current direction
    replicate and expand upon 2+ examples.

    functionality (nav menu) :
        autohide/unhide when scrolling (todo)
