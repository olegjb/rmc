Hello,
This should be a start to a consulting business website example.
For now it includes a menu and a base landing page template.

first need to refine the menu & general ui layer,
    for overall 'feel' of the website.

current direction
    replicate and expand upon 2+ examples.

    functionality (nav menu) :
        autohide/unhide when scrolling (complete)
        move image vertically when scrolling (todo).


once base landing page is set 
    refactor for customization (todo)
        choice of main hue (complete)
        choice of palette & display (todo)

    choice of fonts (complete)

refactor to make a setting menu (todo)
    allow expanded menu to be dynamic (ex, base, settings, advanced)
        or show with tabs?



each section should be its own file/template (todo)
    ex: hero section will load a template based on user choice
        same with menu/nav, content, footer, ect
